# Hello, Illumi!
It's time to rethink our priorities, don't you think?

Illumi Engineering is an organization dedicated to writing high-quality free and open-source decentralized software that is by the people, for the people.

Anybody who is interested can join us and contribute, and we strive to sponsor projects that we benefit from.

## Illumi Engineering is now subscribed to [t/prog, or Transcendent Progressivism](https://tprog.tech).

In the easiest way to put it, Transcendent Progressivism is a socioeconomic and philosophical movement that focuses on accelerating society through means of technological advancement. It focuses on a few key points, a lot of which align with my ideals and some of which align with Illumi Engineering's goals:

### Decentralized Collaborative Governance Through Technology
The goals of Illumi Engineering are to focus on free and decentralized technology, by the people for the people. Illumi is, at its core an open source organization, and t/prog yearns for an open-source, decentralized government. We'd like to help make that happen.

### Inclusion and Freedom of Gender Expression
Illumi Engineering will always be a safe space for trans and gender non-conforming individuals. t/prog strives to make this a given at the core of our society.

### Universal Well Being
Illumi Engineering strives to make the lives of people on earth better through software and technological advancement

### Fostering Cooperation and Collective Benefit
Illumi Engineering intends to give back to the communities it is a part of through cooperative effort in building high quality open source software and tools.

We recommend reading the entire document, but it's long so the ToC is a good place to start. It does an excellent job of outlining the societal ideals t/prog strives to accomplish at a high level.
